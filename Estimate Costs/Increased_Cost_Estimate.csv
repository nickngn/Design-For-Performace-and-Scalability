Rationale:
Because the demand is higher, so we need some changes:
Add: I add 2 Read replica nodes to us-west-2 for Disaster Recovery purpose, and Cognito to enhance security.
Changes: I increase more Data transfer to CloudFront for caching more resources; we also need more storage to S3 to store media & RDS to store user data and metadata; it's also required more Calculation ability to EC2
